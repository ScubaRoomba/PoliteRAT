# PoliteRAT
Remote Access Tool designed to interact with Reddit's API.

This has been an on and off project and since I've been investing more time into it after initial completion, I figured a GitHub page would be appropriate.

DISCLAMER:
  I truly have no idea what I am doing. This is a spaghetti minefield full of bad programming and logic bugs. Plus it only works for Linux.

# Roadmap
- Quite a lot of bug fixing
- Create a version for windows.
- Rewrite the file uploader in Python
- Create a client handler in python, and incorperate the uploader into it.
- Create a simple victim handler. Like a simple upload/download function and "shell <command>"
- Create a "jitter" with the beacons, and allow the sleep timing to be adjusted
- Separate Reddit's API into a class/object/function or whatever to allow for modularity.
